# Todo App

## Description

This is a simple Todo app developed with React and Typescript. I am working on this project as a way
to practice using Typescript with React. In this app, a user can fill out the form, and then a task will
be added to the list below. This task can be edited or deleted with buttons that are displayed on the sides of each task.

## Running

This app is currently using json-server as the backend, so to run the app, first navigate to the project directory and run 'npm run start:server'.
After that is completed run 'npm start' in a serarate terminal. The app should then be brought up in the browser.
